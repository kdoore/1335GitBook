# Intersecting Agents

As we begin our look at dynamic patterns, we can start with a simple ball class that is covered in Shiffman's book, Chapter 10.  He creates a simple Ball class that has position and speed instance variables.  He adds methods to display(), move(), and intersect(Ball b). We can create lists or arrays of these ball objects, and then we can animate these Ball objects by calling move() and display() methods within the processing draw loop.

# Modeling Emotions

In this project, we want design an interactive abstract artwork to represent our personal emotions about some personal event that we remembered as being highly emotional.

In order to recall our emotions that are associated with our selected event, it's helpful to have models of emotion that provide a structure of information about emotions.

## Hour Glass of Emotions
The Hour Glass model of Emotions was created by UX researchers.  This model provides categories of emotion: Sensitivity, Attention, Pleasantness, Aptitude, where Emotions are given a numeric value based on the strength of the emotion.  This dimensional, numeric model has been used to analyze emotional sentiment from written statements such as twitter tweets.  Colors are used in the model to indicate the emotional dimensions.

# Modeling Emotions

In this project, we want design an interactive abstract artwork to represent our personal emotions about some personal event that we remembered as being highly emotional.

In order to recall our emotions that are associated with our selected event, it's helpful to have models of emotion that provide a structure of information about emotions.

#Project 4
For this project, we'll combine projects 2 and 3 to create a parametrically controlled grid pattern application.

We can use the ColorScheme colors to change gradient color values used in the design.  We can use slider controllers to allow changing of the ColorScheme colors.

We will create a Class:  ShapeMatrix that incorporates all of the logic for creating and displaying a ShapeMatrix object from project 2.  The ShapeMatrix will represent a 2D array of Pattern Objects.

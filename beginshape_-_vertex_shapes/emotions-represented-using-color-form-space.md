### Modeling Emotions:  Feeling, Context, Experience:

 Recent research in Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and Computer Science have transformed the understanding of brain, body science.  
 
 [Theory of Constructed Emotions:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion) 

 >A scientific theory to explain the experience and perception of emotion. This theory was proposed by Lisa Feldman Barrett to resolve the "emotion paradox," which has perplexed emotion researchers for decades. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion) 

>The emotion paradox is as follows. People have vivid and intense experiences of emotion in day-to-day life: they report seeing emotions like "anger", "sadness", and "happiness" in others, and they report experiencing "anger", "sadness" and so on themselves. Nevertheless, psychophysiological and neuroscientific evidence has failed to yield consistent support for the existence of such discrete categories of experience.[4] Instead, the empirical evidence suggests that what exists in the brain and body is affect, and emotions are constructed by multiple brain networks working in tandem.[5][6]

> "Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world’s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives."

 [Theory of Constructed Emotions:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion) 

 >A scientific theory to explain the experience and perception of emotion. This theory was proposed by Lisa Feldman Barrett to resolve the "emotion paradox," which has perplexed emotion researchers for decades. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion) 

>"In every waking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of emotion."

**Joseph E. LeDoux**

> "Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world’s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives."

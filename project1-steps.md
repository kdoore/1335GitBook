#Project 1 Steps:

1.  Conceptual Art to Express Emotions
Determine Emotions to express:

Select a personal situation that has strong associated emotions.  Sketch a mind-map / concept-map to brainstorm the concepts and emotions associated with your situation.  
    - Divide your concept-map sketch into 2 regions:  Negative, Positive
    - Put 'Situation' as the center concept ( no need to provide specific details about situation )
    - Add associated concepts to negative or positive sides
    - Add emotions to each side, position the emotions to indicate the strength of emotion - with the strongest emotions located at the outer edges of the regions, neutral emotions near the central dividing line
    - Result:  Select at least 5 emotions to represent in your artwork, list these along the bottom of your concept map. 
    - list in the table: main emotions - ordered list.

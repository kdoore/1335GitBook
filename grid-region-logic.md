#Transforms for Grid Regions

While we can go down the path of putting our complex pattern logic within a nested for-loop, we'll quickly get overwhelmed trying to organize our logic so it's easy to conceptualize.   

After, stepping back to get an overview of the design challenge, we can try a different approach, and this will lead us toward an object-oriented approach to design our prototyping tool.

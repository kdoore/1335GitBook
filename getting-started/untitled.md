### Event-based Programming - Repeated Execution

#### Initialization: setup is executed one time

`void setup( ) {   //code   }`     
 **Processing event function - for initialization - auto-executed once**

### Draw Loop

`void draw( ){  //code }`      
 **Processing event function - auto-executed: event looping: 60 frames/second**

### Static vs Active Mode

**static vs. active mode -** all code, other than global variable declaration/ initialization must be within functions.  
Do not have any code outside of a function definition

If Life is a Game, These are the Rules:  _Cherie Carter Scott_

> **Rule 3:** _**There are no mistakes, only Lessons**_
>
> _Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories.  The **failed experiment** are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work. Cherie Carter Scott_
>
> _**Compassion:**  An Individual is capable of both great **compassion** and great **indifference,** he has it within his means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter._   Norman Cousins
>
> **Rule 4: A lesson is repeated until Learned  
> Lessons will be repeated** to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then on on to the next lesson.   
>
> **Challenge:  Identify and release the patterns that you are repeating** 
>
> **Cultivate:  Awareness, Willingness, Patience, Acknowledge Causality**

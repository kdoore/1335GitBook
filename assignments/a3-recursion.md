# A3: Natural Patterns

Behavior:  Pattern: Looping, Fractal  
Function: Self-Similar Replication  
Structure: Recursion

If Life is a Game, These are the Rules:  _Cherie Carter Scott_

> **Rule 3:** _**There are no mistakes, only Lessons**_
>
> _**Growth is a process of experimentation, a series of trials, errors, and occasional victories**.  The **failed experiment** are as much a part of the process as the experiments that work. Cherie Carter Scott_
>
> _**Compassion:**  An Individual is capable of both great **compassion** and great **indifference,** he has it within his means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter._   Norman Cousins
>
> **Rule 4: A lesson is repeated until Learned  
> Lessons will be repeated** to you in various forms until you have learned them. When you have learned them, you can then on on to the next lesson.   
>
> **Challenge:  Identify and release the patterns that you are repeating** 
>
> **Cultivate:  Awareness, Willingness, Patience, Acknowledge Causality**

I marshaled considerable evidence to show that **feeling is the foundational form of consciousness,** its prerequisite. I also explained both **physiologically and mechanistically the difference between felt and unfelt needs and showed that feelings have concrete consequences.** This enabled me to conclude in Chapter 9 that **‘consciousness is not merely a subjective perspective upon the “real” dynamics of self-organizing systems; it is a function with definite causal powers of its own’.**  _Mark Solms_

> Hunger feels bad, and it feels good to relieve it by eating; a distended bowel feels bad, and it feels good to relieve it by defecating; pain feels bad, and it feels good to withdraw from the source of it. These are bodily affects but the same applies to emotional ones. Separation distress feels bad and we respond to it by seeking reunion. Fear feels bad and we escape it by fleeing the danger \(and sometimes by fainting\). Suffocation alarm and hunger and sleepiness and fear all feel bad, but they feel bad in different ways. Getting rid of them, by contrast, feels good, also in different ways.”

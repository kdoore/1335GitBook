### **Wassily Kandinsky:**  [Concerning the Spiritual In Art](http://www.public-library.uk/ebooks/22/92.pdf)

> Published in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky's text, Über das Geistige in der Kunst, defines three types of painting; impressions, improvisations and compositions. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though composition is developed from a more formal point of view.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky#cite_note-Pompidou-29) Kandinsky compares the [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality) life of humanity to a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid)—the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work. The point of the pyramid is those few, great artists. It is a spiritual pyramid, advancing and ascending slowly even if it sometimes appears immobile. During decadent periods, the [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_%28spirit%29) sinks to the bottom of the pyramid; humanity searches only for external success, ignoring spiritual forces.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky#cite_note-30)

> Colours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy. This effect can be much deeper, however, causing a vibration of the soul or an "inner resonance"—a spiritual effect in which the colour touches the soul itself.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky#cite_note-31) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky#Concerning_the_spiritual_in_art)

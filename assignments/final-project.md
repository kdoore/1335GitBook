> The mathematical descriptions of quantum physics have a variety of experimentally confirmed consequences that — I would say — **preclude the possibility of a world of mind-independent material substances governed by material causation.**

> The very fact that we can make a causally disconnected choice of whether wave or particle phenomena are manifested in a quantum system essentially shows that **there is no measurement-independent and causally connected, substantial material reality at the micro physical level. It is created by the measurement itself.**

> “Indeed, it has been shown that when our emotional capacities have to process an unpleasant visual stimulus, for example if we are asked to evaluate the time of the appearance of a large spider, we will overestimate the time that passes, giving the impression that it is flowing more quickly than it actually does”, explains Nicolas Burra.
>
> Thus, **our ability to evaluate time is disturbed by the emotional charge and accelerates.** On the contrary, when the visual stimulus is processed by attention, the opposite effect occurs: focused on a stimulus that is very important for our attention, we underestimate the time that elapses and look at the object longer than we imagined.

> “By analyzing how long a person estimates that he or she has been looking at an object, we can determine whether the eye contact between two people is more attention-seeking or emotion-seeking”, says the Geneva-based researcher.

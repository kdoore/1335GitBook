#UML Class Diagram

A UML Class diagram provides a diagramatic representation of the features of a class. In addition, a UML class diagram shows relationships between different classes, such as inheritance and composition. 

The UML Class diagram below shows 
  - class name: Ball, 
  - class properties or instance variables: x, y, size.
  - methods (functions): move(), display( )
  
Some UML class diagrams also show constructor methods.

Bauhaus

>the Bauhaus began as a protest against the thoughtless direction of industrialization, the harm it did to mind and spirit. “Only work which is the product of an inner compulsion can have spiritual meaning,” Gropius wrote in 1923. “Mechanized work is lifeless, proper only to the lifeless machine ... The solution depends on a change in the individual’s attitude toward his work.” [New York Times Aricle](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/t-magazine/bauhaus-school-architecture-history.html?mc=aud_dev&ad-keywords=auddevgate&subid1=TAFI&ad_name=INTER_20_XXXX_XXX_1P_CD_XX_XX_SITEVISITXREM_X_XXXX_COUSA_P_X_X_EN_FBIG_OA_XXXX_00_EN_JP_NFLINKS&adset_name=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F02%2F04%2Ft-magazine%2Fbauhaus-school-architecture-history.html&campaign_id=23843321496910063&fbclid=IwAR2Z6cThd62bgrpEfIeUxUZFQYxXwCoD50f8H8exWxXL3cqLwXzmTBNXg4E)

### [Modeling Creativity:](../resources-and-references/resources/creativity.md)

> Intuitively, a model for \(artistic\) artificial creativity appears to involve the steps illustrated in figure 1. A “good idea”, that is, a novel and appropriate solution to a given problem, is selected or combined from a pool of many possible ideas \(chapters 4 and 5\). A work \(of art\) that captures this idea is then created \(chapters 2 and 3\). The work is then evaluated by the author or a community of knowledgeable peers \(chapters 6 and 7\). Following a negative evaluation, the idea is subsequently adapted \(chapter 1\). We will test this conjecture in a number of case studies and ground it in the literature.

> Intuitively, a **model** for **\(artistic\) artificial creativity** appears to involve the steps illustrated in figure 1. A **“good idea”**, that is, a novel and appropriate solution to a given problem, is selected or **combined from a pool of many possible ideas** \(chapters 4 and 5\). **A work \(of art\) that captures this idea is then created** \(chapters 2 and 3\). **The work is then evaluated** by the author or a community of knowledgeable peers \(chapters 6 and 7\). Following a **negative evaluation, the idea is subsequently adapted** \(chapter 1\). We will test this conjecture in a number of case studies and ground it in the literature.

### [Nodebox: ](https://www.nodebox.net/download/) Tom D. DeSmedt

Nodebox is a visual programming application based on the paradigm of data-flow, as opposed to control-flow paradigm used in Java.  Generative art, parametric architecture and design applications often use the data-flow paradigm which uses a network of connected nodes to represent transformations to data that flows through the system.

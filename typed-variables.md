###Variables

Variables can be considered as named containers to hold values that can be modified. Since Processing is based on the Java language, it uses statically-typed variables, this means that a variable must be declared as a specific data-type before it can be used in a program; in addition, once declared, the variable cannot be modified to refer to a different type of data later in the program.
When representing data in our programs, we can consider hard-coded values as literal values, and we can consider 2 main categories of variables: primitive-type , or composite variables.

###Literal Values

When we initialize variables, we often write a number or character symbol to represent a fixed value such as 10 for the numeric value 10. When we use literal values, these are associated with a specific type of data, for example, 10 is an integer-type literal, while 10.0 is a floating-point type of literal value.

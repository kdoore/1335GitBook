#Variables

Variables can be considered as named containers to hold values that can be modified. Since Processing is based on the Java language, it uses statically-typed variables, this means that a variable must be declared as a specific data-type before it can be used in a program; in addition, once declared, the variable cannot be modified to refer to a different type of data later in the program.
When representing data in our programs, we can consider hard-coded values as literal values, and we can consider 2 main categories of variables: primitive-type , or composite variables.

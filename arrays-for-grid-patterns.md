# Arrays for Grid Patterns

![](/assets/Screenshot 2017-09-12 12.10.55.png)

The image above shows a grid-based pattern that we'll create and use as a guide to create more complex design patterns.

When we look at this image, we can see some design patterns - if we can decompose the design to a set of rules, then we can begin to understand how to write code to create it.

Observable Rules in the design: 

- shapes are arranged in a grid of rows and columns
- colors are changing across the rows and columns
    hue varies according to ROYGBIV pattern
    part of each pattern has full Sat, Bright
    part of each pattern has reduced Sat, Bright
    
- background color - grayscale changes across the rows and columns

- Number of rows, 10 = number of columns 10

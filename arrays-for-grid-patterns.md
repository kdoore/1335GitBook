#Grid Pattern Designs

![](/assets/Screenshot 2017-09-12 12.10.55.png)

The image above shows a grid-based pattern that we'll create and use as a guide to create more complex design patterns.
We'll use [Victor Vasarely's](https://kdoore.gitbooks.io/cs1335/content/vasarely.html) artwork as inspiration for creating grid-based abstract art.

When we look at this image, we can see some design patterns - if we can decompose the design to a set of rules, then we can begin to understand how to write code to create it.

###Observing Patterns and Rules in the Design: 

- shapes are arranged in a grid of rows and columns
- colors are changing across the rows and columns
    - hue varies according to ROYGBIV pattern
    - part of each pattern has full Sat, Bright
    - part of each pattern has reduced Sat, Bright
    
- background color - grayscale changes across the rows and columns

- Number of rows, 10 == number of columns 10
- Cell width == cell height
